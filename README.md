# markdown-highlight-mode

Emacs major mode for Markdown syntax highlighting.

# IMPORTANT NOTICE

The forked version of markdown-mode is hosted on github https://github.com/milkypostman/markdown-mode

It fixes some bugs including the weird behaviour of `dabbrev-expand` (the reason of my motivation).

I strongly recommend to use it instead of my poor implementation. I have no plan to improve this product at present.

Thank you for your attention.
